# CryptoClustering
Repository for Module 19 Unsupervised Learning.
In this challenge, stock data is prepared using standard scaling, then the best value for k is find using the elbow method and clusters are plotted using K-means for both the original data and PCA values. \
From the analysis, it was found that the best value for k in both scenarios is 4 with the cluster plot values using PCA were much more condensed.\
\
The data csv file can be found under the 'Resources' directory named 'crypto_market_data.csv', which is used for analysis in the file 'Crypto_Clustering.ipynb' on the main page.
